## Docs
- [DOC-01] **MUST** have root `README.md`: quickstart, architecture overview, common tasks.
- [DOC-02] **MUST** place deeper guides under `docs/`; decisions under `docs/adr/`; ops under `docs/runbooks/`.
- [DOC-03] **SHOULD** use diagrams-as-code (Mermaid/PlantUML); keep docs in lockstep with code.

## API Docs
- [DOC-API-01] **MUST** generate docs from the contract source (OpenAPI/proto/GraphQL schema); version & publish.
