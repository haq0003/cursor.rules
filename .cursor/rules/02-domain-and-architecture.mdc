## Domain & Boundaries
- [ARCH-01] **MUST** capture ubiquitous language; map domain concepts to explicit types.
- [ARCH-02] **MUST** bind each microservice to one capability; **MUST NOT** share databases.
- [ARCH-03] **SHOULD** introduce service aggregation (Façade/BFF) to decouple clients.

## Contracts & Versions
- [ARCH-04] **MUST** expose only APIs and events at boundaries; wrap third-party libs behind interfaces.
- [ARCH-05] **MUST** keep changes backward compatible; breaking changes require major version & migration plan.

## Exceptions
- [ADR-01] **MUST** record ADRs for boundary, ownership, or protocol changes under `docs/adr/`.
