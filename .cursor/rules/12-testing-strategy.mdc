## Strategy
- [TEST-01] **SHOULD** apply testing pyramid: many unit, fewer integration, very few E2E (critical journeys).
- [TEST-02] **MUST** name tests by behavior (GWT or Arrange/Act/Assert).

## Unit
- [TEST-U-01] **MUST** keep tests deterministic, isolated, fast; mocks only at boundaries.

## Integration
- [TEST-I-01] **SHOULD** use real infra via containers (DB, MQ, HTTP); seed via migrations/fixtures.

## E2E
- [TEST-E2E-01] **MUST** run in hermetic env (compose or ephemeral k8s namespace).

## Non-functional
- [TEST-NF-01] **SHOULD** define SLAs for latency/throughput; include soak/stability tests.
- [TEST-NF-02] **SHOULD** automate SAST/DAST in the pipeline.
